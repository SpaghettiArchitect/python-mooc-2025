# My Solutions for Python Programming MOOC 2025

This repository contains all my solutions for the [Python Programming MOOC 2025](https://programming-25.mooc.fi/) made by the University of Helsinki. It does not contain the final project for the Advance part, that one is on [another repository](https://github.com/SpaghettiArchitect/simple_platformer).

I am sharing this repo in the hope that other people that take the course can learn from my solutions and mistakes (also to keep track of my learning). DO NOT SIMPLY COPY AND PASTE MY SCRIPTS TO EARN THE CERTIFICATE/CREDITS! Be honest with yourself.
